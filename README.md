### 2) Action Classfication
#### How to collect the training data which describes the action which can do with a cat ?
- Data was collected manually using Microsoft Kinect3D which can capture human motion in 3D using a stereo camera. 

- CatSimulator can classify human's action using sequenctial 3D data for cetain action, which is clapping, stroking, or hugging with 
- This project was made for graudation project to get a bachelor's degree. We made behavior classifier using sequential 3D data (x, y, z axis for certain action)
- Related language and tools: C#, Unity
